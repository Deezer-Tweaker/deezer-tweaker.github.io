# Creating a theme

Anyone can contribute to the themes list. You just need a code editor and a GitHub account.

## Setting up

First, create a fork of the [`Deezer-Tweaker/community-themes`](https://github.com/Deezer-Tweaker/community-themes) repository,
then clone it to your computer.

## Creating your theme file

The structure of the files and folders of your theme **must** be the following:

```
project root/
  README.md
  ...
  
  <theme name>/
    <theme name>.css
```

Your theme name must start with a capital letter, must not include spaces or special characters.
