# Creating your plugin

Anyone can contribute to the plugins list. You just need a code editor and a GitHub account.

## Setting up

First, create a fork of the [`Deezer-Tweaker/community-plugins`](https://github.com/Deezer-Tweaker/community-plugins) repository,
then clone it to your computer.

## Creating your plugin's file

The structure of the files and folders of your plugin **must** be the following:

```
project root/
  README.md
  ...
  
  <plugin name>/
    <plugin name>.js
```

Your plugin name must start with a capital letter, must not include spaces or special characters.
